Differences between HW1 and HW2
------------------------------

This time around I decided to program the shapes example in C++. First, I made the base class Shape an abstract class. In python I forgot to make Shape abstract so the user could instantiate shape. This doesn't make much sense in the context of the program because "shape" doesn't have a specific amount of sides. This could lead to issues down the line if we were to expand upon the program.

The next thing I changed between homework 1 and homework 2 is that I delegated the task of displaying the shapes to a seperate class. So each shape subclass HAS-A Display object. This is nice because each shape doesn't have to worry about implementing it's own display function as it has an object that does it for them. I can now see why it's better to favor delegation over inheritance.

Lastly, I added access specifiers to ALL of the data in this program. This helps adhere to the principle of encapsulation and makes my program much more safe in the long run.

Those three things (along with a few minor changes to how the code is stuctured) are the changes I made between homework 1 and homework 2
